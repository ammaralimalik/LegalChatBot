This should not be used instead of a legal professional, it is a project showcasing my abilities in the realm of AI and ML.

This is a chatbot application geared towards answering legal questions for Pakistani law. This project is meant to showcase RAG capabilities with different models. 
I used Deepseek R-1 for this mostly due to it's chain of thought capabilities.
Front end is made with the streamlit library.
Will be adding a chat history db along with it.
